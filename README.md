# A Web Crawler (Scrapy + Splash + MongoDB)

***Project description***: 

This is a project to crawl the names of APPs on www.mi.com. The detailed description can be found **[here](https://www.bittiger.io/microprojects)**.

Basically the final code will crawl the http://app.mi.com/, grab all the APPs' name and store them into a MongoDB database.

I delevoped these codes based on two useful tutorials, (**[here](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html)** and **[here](https://realpython.com/blog/python/web-scraping-with-scrapy-and-mongodb/)**)however, both of them have some obsolete codes in there so I had some modifications.

The master brand codes finish the first two steps of this project: crawl the main page and store the APPs' names into a MongoDB database.

The final step is to use Splash to crawl some linked pages, not only the main page. I am actively working on this final step now.
